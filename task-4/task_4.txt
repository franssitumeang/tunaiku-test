for adding new column on bigquery table, I think there are 2 ways to solve it

1. It can be handled by BigQueryOperator Airflow
for example there is a existing table on bigquery with 3 fields
and revamp code on task Airflow using BigQueryOperator and then run, field automatically will adding in that table

2. Using bigquery API
